# Set server verbosity to 'debug'
# it can be one of:
# debug (a lot of information, useful for development/testing)
# verbose (many rarely useful info, but not a mess like the debug level)
# notice (moderately verbose, what you want in production probably)
# warning (only very important / critical messages are logged)

# Redis to log on the standard output. Note that if you use standard
# output for logging but daemonize, logs will be sent to /dev/null

# The DB will be written inside this directory, with the filename specified
